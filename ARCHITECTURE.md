## Architecture Overview

The Blog App is built using a layered architecture:

- **UI Layer**: React components that render the user interface
- **State Layer**: Custom hooks and React state for managing component state
- **Service Layer**: API services for interacting with the backend
- **Data Layer**: Supabase database for persistent storage

This separation of concerns ensures that each part of the application is focused on a specific responsibility, making the code more maintainable and testable.

## Component Structure

The component structure follows a hierarchical pattern:

```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/         # Shared, highly reusable components
│   ├── ui/             # Low-level UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
│   └── ...             # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── pages/              # Page components
├── services/           # API and other services
└── utils/              # Utility functions and helpers
```

### Key Components

- **App.jsx**: The main application component that defines routes
- **Header.jsx**: Navigation header with dynamic category links
- **Footer.jsx**: Page footer with site information
- **PostPage.jsx**: Displays a single post with related posts
- **HomePage.jsx**: Displays featured and latest posts
- **CategoryPage.jsx**: Displays posts filtered by category

## Data Flow

Data flows through the application in the following manner:

1. **Data Fetching**: 
   - Services fetch data from Supabase or fallback to mock data
   - Enhanced API includes caching for performance
   - Hooks provide loading, error states, and pagination

2. **State Management**:
   - Page components use hooks to fetch and manage data
   - UI state is managed at the component level
   - Global state (like category lists) is shared via hooks

3. **Rendering**:
   - Components receive data via props
   - Components handle their own loading and error states
   - Reusable components ensure consistent UI

## State Management

State is managed primarily through React hooks:

- **useBlog.js**: Contains hooks for blog-specific data (posts, categories, etc.)
- **useFetch.js**: Generic data fetching hooks with loading, error states
- **useUI.js**: UI-related state (theme, modals, notifications)

### Key State Patterns

- **Data Fetching State**: Loading, error, and data states for API calls
- **UI State**: Modal visibility, active tabs, animations
- **User Interaction State**: Likes, views, and other engagement metrics
- **Form State**: Input values, validation, and submission status

## Services

The services layer handles all data access:

### API Service

Located in `services/api.js` and enhanced in `services/enhancedApi.js`:

- **categoriesService**: Manages blog categories
- **postsService**: Manages blog posts
- **engagementService**: Handles user interactions (likes, views)

### Supabase Service

Located in `services/supabase.js`:

- Configures Supabase client
- Provides fallback for when Supabase is not configured
- Handles anonymous authentication for likes

## Reusable Components

The application has a rich set of reusable components:

### Common Components

Located in `components/common/`:

- **ImageWithFallback**: Image component with error handling and fallbacks
- **PostCard**: Card component for displaying post previews
- **PostList**: List component for displaying posts with pagination
- **CategoryBadge**: Badge component for displaying category labels
- **LikeButton**: Button component for liking posts
- **PageHeader**: Header component for page titles and descriptions

### UI Components

Located in `components/ui/`:

- **Button**: Reusable button component with variants
- **LoadingSpinner**: Loading indicator components
- **ErrorMessage**: Error display components
- **Toast**: Notification component
- **Markdown**: Markdown rendering component

## Hooks

Custom hooks provide reusable logic:

### Blog Hooks

Located in `hooks/useBlog.js`:

- **usePosts**: Fetches and manages posts with pagination
- **usePost**: Fetches and manages a single post
- **useCategories**: Fetches and manages categories
- **usePostEngagement**: Manages post engagement (views, likes)
- **useCategoryPosts**: Fetches posts by category
- **useFeaturedPosts**: Fetches featured posts

### Fetch Hooks

Located in `hooks/useFetch.js`:

- **useFetch**: Generic data fetching with loading, error states
- **usePagination**: Handles paginated data fetching
- **useInfiniteScroll**: Implements infinite scrolling

## Utils

Utility functions provide reusable helper logic:

- **imageUtils.js**: Utilities for image handling and fallbacks
- **colorUtils.js**: Utilities for category colors and themes
- **dataService.js**: Utilities for data caching and optimization

## Performance Optimizations

The application includes several performance optimizations:

- **Data Caching**: The enhanced API service includes caching to minimize duplicate requests
- **Pagination**: Data is loaded in smaller chunks to improve initial load times
- **Lazy Loading**: Images use lazy loading to improve page load performance
- **Component Optimization**: Components are designed to minimize re-renders

## Supabase Integration

The application integrates with Supabase for data storage:

### Database Schema

Located in `database-setup.sql`:

- **categories**: Stores blog categories
- **posts**: Stores blog posts
- **likes**: Stores user likes
- **post_views**: Stores post view counts

### Supabase Features Used

- **Authentication**: Anonymous authentication for likes
- **Database**: Postgres database for storing blog data
- **Row Level Security**: Secure access control
- **RPC Functions**: Atomic updates for views and likes

### Fallback Mechanism

The application includes a fallback mechanism for when Supabase is not configured:

- Mock data is provided for development
- Error handling ensures the application doesn't crash
- Console warnings indicate when fallbacks are being used
